* Expose "attacker tagged with my:custom_tag" rule to regular config
* Check that the default config behavior is the same as Apathetic Mobs's default config
* Implement the special handling for bosses
* impl Spirit's JSON concept!
* Check rule optimizer behavior for things like "mobSet is empty, mobSetExcluded isn't pass"
* Write tests for the rule optimizer

## no dragon

* Add some way to get dragon's breath
