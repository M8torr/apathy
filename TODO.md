# TODO:

* Check that the default config behavior is the same as Apathetic Mobs's default config
* Write tests for the rule optimizer
* Look into adding new game difficulties (will probably need a separate library cuz it's not easy + touches a lot)

## no dragon

* Add some way to get dragon's breath

## Wishlist

* (internal note) Might be worth it to transition from TriState to a dedicated enum with better names. I'm a bit entrenched though
