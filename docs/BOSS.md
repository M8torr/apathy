# Boss config

## No dragon

Disables the Ender Dragon fight.

* The Ender Dragon will not spawn when you visit the End.
* The exit End portal will already be open, and have the Egg on top.
* Placing four end crystals on the End portal generates a new End Gateway.

Notes:

* Existing Ender Dragons will be deleted.

## No wither

Disables the Wither boss fight.

* Building the Wither multiblock will simply spawn a nether star item.

Notes:

* Existing Withers are *not* deleted. You can still summon Withers using commands.
* The Wither is *created* but never *spawned*.
* The drops are created by simulating an (anvil) kill. You can use a loot table to further customize drops.
